Hello, my name is Mohamed Mahad Farah and I was born in Mogadishu,
Somalia. I have a strong desire to live in Canada,
a country known for its welcoming attitude towards immigrants and multiculturalism.
In my free time, I enjoy watching the TV show "Prison Break",
which tells the story of a man trying to break his brother out of prison.
I am a determined and persevering individual who is working hard to achieve my goals.
